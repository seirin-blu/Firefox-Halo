## Changelog
Init and v1.0.0: These update are the inital commits and bug fixes to the code. They cover a lot of the features meant to be in the config but not all of them.

v2.0.0: This update is a massive overhaul to the code. This fixes bugs and adds support for a customized private browsing page. You will need to have the assets Firefox Halo with Paw Private.png and Favicon Private.png downloaded and in the same location as userChrome.css and userContent.css for this update to work as intended. The others do not need to be downloaded but having them linked here may soon become a legacy feature. When it comes out, v2.5.0 will organize the code in an order that makes more sense.

v2.1.0: This probably destroyed everyone who was using this before this update's experience. If that's you, I'm sorry, I had to redo some structuring.
